## Running this code

I wrote this code in Haskell because Prof. Efros said we could use any language! I apologize if you have to run the code. You have to install Stack, a program that manages projects for haskell. Then run `stack-build`. Then, use the executable by running `stack-exec <project-name>-exe [input file] [output file]`. The code is in `src/Lib.hs`. The main function is called `someFunc`
