## Running this code

I wrote this code in Haskell because Prof. Efros said we could use any language! I apologize if you have to run the code. You have to install Stack, a program that manages projects for haskell. Then run `stack-build`. Then, use the executable by running `stack-exec quilt`, `stack-exec texture`, or `stack-exec seam`. The code is in `src/`. The  executable programs are in the folders corresponding to the names above. Cheers!
