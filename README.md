## Running this code

I wrote this code in Haskell because Prof. Efros said we could use any language! I apologize if you have to run the code. You have to install Stack, a program that manages projects for haskell. Then run `stack-build`. Then, use the executable by running `stack-exec <exec>`. The code is in `src/P3.hs`. The  executable programs are in `proj3/`. The helper python files are cps.py and avg.py
